# webscraping 

This is a webscraping and EDA analysis developed as a part of a student project at NYC Data Science Bootcamp fall 2017.

Data is scraped from boligsiden.dk and contains information of house sold in Denmark during the last five years.
The EDA part pre-processed the data and explores the different variables. Also, multiple regression is conducted to forecast house sales prices.
